    <h1 style="font-size:3vw";>Domestic and Wild animals</h1>
    <center><p style="font-size:1.5vw";>Animals, animal animals 
        (lat. Animalia) â€” one of the main kingdoms of living beings 
        (the second kingdom is plants). Animals are heterotrophic 
        devices. This species of the simplest (Euglena) feeds both 
        heterotrophically and autotrophically. In the modern era, 
        there are 1.5 to 2 million species of animals (according to 
        scientists, this number may reach 10 million), M. Sh. There 
        are more than 1 million arthropods. Different systematists 
        divide what are considered different types of animals. The 
        more common types are: protozoans (some divide these types 
        into 5 types), sponges, gastropods, flatworms, nemertines, 
        roundworms, flatworms, ringworms, arthropods, mosses, 
        copepods, clinians, cabins, clinians, semichordians, and 
        chordians.</p></center>

    <center><p style="font-size:1.5vw";>Animals are very important in human life. They are used as 
        food, traction power, industrial raw material and others. 
        Some animals are harmful to one or another branch of the 
        public economy. Their role in preserving the environment 
        as it is today is worth mentioning. A large part of the 
        population does not understand this importance, and this 
        is the main reason for the problems faced by the animal 
        world. Many species are extirpated or threatened with 
        extinction due to unsparing destruction and improper 
        interference in natural processes. Currently, effective 
        measures are being taken to regulate, protect, and reproduce 
        the species of animals (laws have been issued, nature 
        reserves have been established, prohibitions have been 
        introduced, the "Red Book" has been introduced, etc.). 
        However, judging by the results, it turns out that the 
        progression of animal world degradation approaches geometric 
        progression. There is an opinion that the process of 
        degeneration of nature, which is so obvious, is one of 
        the stages of evolutionary development, and therefore 
        the disappearance of species or entire ecosystems is not 
        a sign that the entire living nature is threatened. But 
        until such assumptions take the form of a theory (although 
        it may never happen), humanity is taking a big risk.</p></center>
