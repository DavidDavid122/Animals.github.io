  <center><h1>Eagle</h1></center>
  <hr>
  <p >Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family 
    Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are 
    closely related. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and 
    Africa.Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—2 in North America, 
    9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia.Eagles are not a 
    natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough 
    to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrates.

  <h1>Description</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Eagles are large, powerfully-built birds of prey, with heavy heads and 
    beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle (Aquila 
    pennata), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or 
    red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly 
    broad wings, and more direct, faster flight – despite the reduced size of 
    aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart 
    from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the South Nicobar 
    serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (1 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The 
    largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have 
    very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, 
    muscular legs, and powerful talons.The beak is typically heavier than that 
    of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It is 
    estimated that the martial eagle, whose eyes are more than two times 
    larger than the human eye, has a visual acuity up to 8 times that of 
    humans. This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long 
    distance.This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely 
    large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming 
    light. The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male.
    Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high 
    cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently 
    kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The parents take no action 
    to stop the killing. It is said that eagles fly above clouds but this is 
    not true. Eagles fly during storms and glide from the winds pressure. This 
    saves the bird's energy. Due to the size and power of many eagle species, 
    they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the 
    avian world. The type of prey varies by genus. The Haliaeetus and 
    Ichthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish, though the species in the 
    former often capture various animals, especially other water birds, and 
    are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent eagles 
    of the genera Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis predominantly prey on 
    the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The 
    eagles of the genus Aquila are often the top birds of prey in open 
    habitats, taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where 
    Aquila eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested 
    buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top raptorial 
    predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the species-rich genus 
    Spizaetus, live predominantly in woodlands and forests. These eagles often 
    target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are 
    often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting 
    techniques differ among the species and genera, with some individual eagles 
    having engaged in quite varied techniques based on their environment and 
    prey at any given time. Most eagles grab prey without landing and take 
    flight with it, so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.The 
    bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be 
    carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew with a 6.8 kg (15 lb) mule 
    deer fawn.However, a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier 
    than themselves; such prey is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either 
    eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest. 
    Golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg (66 
    lb) and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg (82 lb) duiker, 7–8 times 
    heavier than the preying eagle.Authors on birds David Allen Sibley, Pete 
    Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting 
    eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and golden 
    eagles as compared to other North American raptors):They have at least one 
    singular characteristic. It has been observed that most birds of prey look 
    back over their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter); 
    predation is after all a two-edged sword. All hawks seem to have this 
    habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest Ferruginous – but not the 
    Eagles.Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the 
    condors and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. It is 
    regularly debated which should be considered the largest species of eagle. 
    They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan. 
    Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable 
    measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling 
    eagles, including the very large harpy eagle, have relatively short 
    wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short 
    bursts through densely forested habitats. Eagles in the genus Aquila, 
    found almost exclusively in open country, are noted for their ability to 
    soar, and have relatively long wings for their size.These lists of the top 
    five eagles are based on weight, length, and wingspan, respectively. 
    Unless otherwise noted by reference, the figures listed are the median 
    reported for each measurement in the guide Raptors of the World in which 
    only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were 
    listed.

  <h1>Habitat</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The eagles are generally distributed in all types of habitats and nearly 
    all parts of the world. The birds can be found in northern tundra to 
    tropical rainforests and deserts. In North America, bald eagles and golden 
    eagles are very common.The other nine species are endemic to Central and 
    South America. The birds have a highly concentrated population in the 
    Africa and eastern hemisphere. Several islands in the Indian and Pacific 
    Oceans are also rich and have distinct species of eagles.
  </p>
  <hr><hr>
  <h1>Groups</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Eagles are often informally divided into four groups.The snake eagles are 
    placed in the subfamily Circaetinae. The fish eagles, booted eagles, and 
    harpy eagles have traditionally been placed in the subfamily Buteoninae 
    together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and harriers. Some 
    authors may treat these groups as tribes of the Buteoninae; Lerner & 
    Mindell proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of 
    Accipitridae.

  <h2>Fish eagles</h2>
  <p>Sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets, 
    either fresh or as carrion.Proposed subfamily Haliaeetinae. Genera: 
    Haliaeetus, Ichthyophaga.Some authors include Gypohierax angolensis, the 
    "vulturine fish eagle" (also called the palm-nut vulture) in this group.
    However, genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of 
    Neophron–Gypaetus–Eutriorchis (Egyptian vulture, bearded vulture 
    (lammergeier), and Madagascar serpent eagle).The fish eagles have a close 
    genetic relationship with Haliastur and Milvus; the whole group is only 
    distantly related to the Buteo group.

  </a></div>The modern English term for the bird is derived from Latin: aquila by way 
    of French: aigle. The origin of aquila is unknown, but it is believed to 
    possibly derive from aquilus (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) 
    as a reference to the plumage of eagles.Old English used the term earn, 
    related to Scandinavia's ørn/örn. It is similar to other Indo-European 
    terms for "bird" or "eagle", including Greek: ὄρνις (ornís), Russian: 
    орёл (orël), and Welsh: eryr.In the southern part of Finland, near the 
    Gulf of Finland, is the town of Kotka, which literally means "eagle", 
    while the town of L'Aquila in the central part of Italy literally means 
    "the eagle".In Britain before 1678, eagle referred specifically to the 
    golden eagle, with the other native species, the white-tailed eagle, being 
    known as erne. The modern name "golden eagle" for aquila chrysaetos was 
    introduced by the naturalist John Ray.The village of Eagle in 
    Lincolnshire, England, has nothing to do with the bird; its name is 
    derived from the Old English words for "oak" and "wood" (compare Oakley).
