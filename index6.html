  <center><h1>King Animal</h1></center>
  <hr>
  <p>King Animal is the sixth, and final, studio album by American rock band 
    Soundgarden—their first in sixteen years. Produced by both the band and 
    Adam Kasper, it was released on November 13, 2012, by Seven Four 
    Entertainment and Republic Records in the United States, and by Vertigo 
    Records in the rest of the world. It was the first of Soundgarden's albums 
    not to be released on A&M Records since 1988's Ultramega OK, though 
    Republic, Vertigo, and A&M are all owned by Universal Music Group. The 
    album was the final studio album released by Soundgarden before the death 
    of frontman Chris Cornell in 2017 and the subsequent dissolution of the 
    band in 2018.

  <h1>Background and recording</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>In January 2010, Chris Cornell announced that, 13 years after their 
    break-up, Soundgarden had reunited.At first, the band was primarily 
    interested in relearning their old songs and playing them live, but 
    Cornell declared that "It would be exciting to record one song, to hear 
    how Soundgarden-ish that might be this much time later." The band's first 
    studio work was finishing the song "Black Rain" for the compilation 
    Telephantasm (2010), which guitarist Kim Thayil said "showed our 
    evolvement creatively", and in late 2010 drummer Matt Cameron booked 
    studio time to show some song ideas and have the band compose some more 
    through jam sessions.In February 2011, it was announced on Soundgarden's 
    homepage that they had started writing new songs. One month later, 
    recording sessions for a new album began at Seattle's Studio X, with 
    producer Adam Kasper. The sessions were interrupted by the end of the 
    month so Cornell could move onto his solo "Songbook" tour, which would be 
    interspersed with Soundgarden concerts. As the band's contract with A&M 
    Records was fulfilled after releasing Telephantasm and the live album Live 
    on I-5 (2011), Soundgarden produced King Animal independently.Cameron 
    claimed in April 2011 that the album would be released later that year,
    but the recording was prolonged, with Thayil saying: "the more we enjoy 
    it, the more our fans should end up enjoying it." In October, Cornell said 
    the band would return to the studio in December and the album was "mostly 
    done, we just need to finish a couple of songs and mix it, so that will be 
    happening probably over the holidays."In May 2012, the band reported they 
    were eyeing a release that October. On September 17, it was announced that 
    the album would be titled King Animal and would be released on November 
    13, 2012. Cornell said the title relates to how the band "were a big 
    fish in a small pond, and we sort of graduated. There was a sense of us 
    feeling like it was us four against the world. We clearly had that from 
    the very beginning. In some weird way after all this time, we persevered. 
    The album kind of stands out as a symbol and an indication of that."

  <h1>Composition and style</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The band reported that they had 12 to 14 songs that were "kind of ready 
    to go" in March 2011, and the material for the album was "90 percent new".
    One of the songs that is an updated version of an older idea is "Taree", 
    which bassist Ben Shepherd wrote in the late 1990s. He had recorded a demo 
    of the song for his solo album In Deep Owl (2013) before the band's 
    ureunion, but then decided it deserved a full-band treatment.In June 2011, 
    Thayil said some songs on the album would sound "similar in a sense to 
    Down on the Upside", and the album "pick[s] up where we left off. There 
    are some heavy moments, and there are some fast songs",though the 
    maturation of the musicians during the band's hiatus has also been said to 
    evident.

  <h1>Artwork</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The album's cover and subsequent art direction is based on a sculpture 
    titled "Night of the Last Equinox" by Josh Graham, who Thayil sought out 
    after seeing the artwork Graham had done for his band A Storm of Light. 
    Featuring animal skulls above a field of flowers in a snowy forest, the 
    sculpture features a recurring motif of Graham's art: the juxtaposition 
    of life and death and how "everything between there is such a massive part 
    of the human condition." Cornell said the art was inspired by Graham's 
    interpretation of the songs, and he felt it was a good fit, given the 
    band's frequent moody lyrics with an outdoor theme.Thayil revealed that 
    the band asked for art that featured white and other lighter colors, as 
    "most of our album covers have had a darker pallet". Graham also did the 
    animated backdrops that Soundgarden used during the album's tour and 
    directed the music video for the album's first single, "Been Away Too 
    Long". The pictures of the band members in the booklet that accompanied 
    the album were taken by the band manager Don VanCleave.
  </p>

  <h1>Promotion and release</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>For the release of King Animal, Soundgarden signed a deal with longtime 
    label executive Tom Whalley's new Loma Vista Recordings, and distribution 
    was handled by Loma Vista's partner Republic Records. Cornell said the 
    experience of only seeking a label once the album was completed was 
    "almost like it was in the beginning of the band." To promote the album, 
    the band recorded a track-by-track narrative at Seattle's Moore Theatre 
    and performed intimate concerts at New York's Irving Plaza, Toronto's 
    Phoenix Concert Theatre, and Los Angeles' Fonda Theatre."Been Away Too 
    Long" was released on September 27, 2012, almost seven weeks before the 
    album. Both it and "By Crooked Steps" were used in promotional spots on 
    ESPN for Monday Night Football, and "Been Away Too Long" was used in an 
    episode of Sons of Anarchy. On October 31, 2012, a video for "Non-State 
    Actor" was posted on the official Soundgarden YouTube channel, the visuals 
    consisting of a waving American flag with the King Animal logo in place of 
    the stars. The week before its November 13 release, the whole album could 
    be streamed for free on iTunes. Dave Grohl directed a music video for "By 
    Crooked Steps", which was released on January 29, 2013, and a music video 
    for "Halfway There" was released on September 4.

  <h2>Versions</h2>
  <p>Along with standard CD, double LP, and digital download releases, King 
    Animal was also issued as a deluxe box set that featured the CD with three 
    demos as bonus tracks, the double LP, a DVD of the band's 2012 performance 
    at Hyde Park, and five lithographs. There were several different versions 
    of the CD release, in the United States and internationally, that included 
    various demos as bonus tracks, and for Record Store Day 2013 Soundgarden 
    issued King Animal Demos, a limited edition pink vinyl that collected all 
    six of those demos on a single release. Later in 2013, King Animal Plus 
    was released, which featured five live tracks recorded for Live from the 
    Artists Den at The Wiltern in Los Angeles and an acoustic version of 
    "Halfway There" that Cornell and Shepherd recorded for CIMX-FM in Detroit.

  <h1>Critical reception</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>On Metacritic, the album has a normalized score of 70 out of 100 based on 
    reviews from 32 critics, which indicates it received "generally favorable 
    reviews".Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album a positive 
    review, writing: "King Animal is a big, bright album, executed with 
    precision and professionalism. The band members sound more elderly, not 
    quite as loud, and possess a keener sense of good taste, and it sounds as 
    if they've aged together, which is a testament to their innate chemistry. 
    Simply put, Soundgarden sound like they belong together; Cornell sounds 
    richer, fuller when anchored by drummer Matt Cameron, bassist Ben 
    Shepherd, and the deceptively sinewy and brainy guitarist Kim Thayil, 
    whose presence has sorely been missed over the past decade." Luke Turner 
    of BBC Music was also positive, saying: "King Animal undeniably draws its 
    strength from the band's accessible Superunknown era, but also takes 
    Soundgarden somewhere fresh."Richard Trapunski of Now gave the album four 
    out of five stars and wrote: "King Animal doesn’t sound like a 
    nostalgia-fed cash grab, nor is it poisoned by the desperate commercialism 
    of Cornell's post-Soundgarden projects. Instead, it picks up where 1996's 
    Down on the Upside left off, layering Cornell's distinct howl over 
    psychedelic textures, off-kilter time signatures and heavy, chugging riffs 
    courtesy of way-underrated guitarist Kim Thayil."Chris DeVille of The A.V. 
    Club gave the album a B− and said: "More often, though, King Animal 
    affirms what a potent formula this band established. It's neither a 
    trainwreck nor a masterpiece, but it stirs the senses in all the right 
    ways." Michael Christopher of The Phoenix gave the album three out of four 
    stars and wrote: "On the whole, King Animal is a welcome return, and 
    though it doesn't reinvent the wheel, it reminds us why these guys were 
    considered the architects of the Seattle scene." Tim Karan of the 
    Alternative Press gave the album three and a half out of five stars and 
    said: "It's difficult to imagine a new Soundgarden album that would sound 
    startlingly different from King Animal. It's right in line with the band's 
    natural progression; so much so that it's almost difficult to believe it 
    didn’t come out a decade ago. Is it as evocative and emotive as their 
    earlier albums? Not quite. But it's new Soundgarden songs that sound like 
    old Soundgarden songs—and if you’re of a certain generation or 
    disposition, that's been a long time coming."Hilary Saunders of Paste gave 
    the album a 7.0 out of 10 and wrote: "Comeback albums are notoriously 
    difficult to conceptualize and actualize and King Animal took more than a 
    year to create after the band spent a decade and a half on hiatus. While 
    this record lacks the canonizing tracks like 'Jesus Christ Pose', 'Black 
    Hole Sun', 'Spoonman' and 'Burden in My Hand', Soundgarden deserves to be 
    commended for recapturing the feeling of grunge and reintroducing it 
    today." Matt Melis of Consequence of Sound gave the album a C− and said: 
    "Production issues aside, this record proves that Soundgarden still have 
    their muscle but also hints that they are in the process of figuring out 
    how to flex it again. For every realized track like 'Worse Dreams', with 
    its circular vocal phrasings and slippery riffing, there's a jam like 
    'Eyelid's Mouth' that completely loses its identity — in this case, via 
    an almost painful chorus that asks, 'Who let the river run dry?' Still, 
    there's more than enough merit found in King Animal to ensure that any 
    future tweets by Chris Cornell about new Soundgarden music will 
    confidently be filed under #reallygoodnews."Scott McLennan of The Boston 
    Globe gave the album a mixed review, writing: "There's nothing bad about 
    these 13 tracks, but nothing truly remarkable either. It's been 16 years 
    since singer Chris Cornell, guitarist Kim Thayil, bassist Ben Shepherd, 
    and drummer Matt Cameron applied their combined talents to new songs, and 
    while the old chemistry sounds intact (though can we get more from the 
    drummer, please?) the material is not particularly combustible." Jonathan 
    Keefe of Slant Magazine gave the album three out of five stars and said: 
    "King Animal doesn't contain any standout tracks that justify 
    Soundgarden's comeback or which rank as essential additions to the band's 
    very strong catalogue. The album is less a triumphant return than an 
    example of what happens to most middle-aged rock bands: They've returned 
    as a slightly more conservative version of what made them famous in the 
    first place."[54] Stuart Berman of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 5.9 
    out of 10 and wrote: "The best hope for King Animal was that Soundgarden 
    would be inspired enough by their spiritual successors to want to outdo 
    them, and set a new benchmark for ambitious aggression. Instead, the 
    group's first album since 1996 just sounds like the one they would've 
    churned out in 1998."
