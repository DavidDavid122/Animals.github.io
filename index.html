      <p>The domestication of animals is the mutual relationship 
        between animals and the humans who have influence on their 
        care and reproduction.Charles Darwin recognized a small number 
        of traits that made domesticated species different from their 
        wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the 
        difference between conscious selective breeding (i.e. 
        artificial selection) in which humans directly select for 
        desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits 
        evolve as a by-product of natural selection or from selection 
        on other traits.There is a genetic difference between domestic 
        and wild populations. There is also a genetic difference 
        between the domestication traits that researchers believe to 
        have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and 
        the improvement traits that have appeared since the split 
        between wild and domestic populations.Domestication traits are 
        generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected 
        during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or 
        plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a 
        portion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in 
        individual breeds or regional populations.Domestication should 
        not be confused with taming. Taming is the conditioned 
        behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural 
        avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of 
        humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification 
        of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition 
        toward humans.Certain animal species, and certain individuals 
        within those species, make better candidates for domestication 
        than others because they exhibit certain behavioral 
        characteristics: (1) the size and organization of their social 
        structure; (2) the availability and the degree of selectivity in 
        their choice of mates; (3) the ease and speed with which the 
        parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of 
        the young at birth; (4) the degree of flexibility in diet and 
        habitat tolerance; and (5) responses to humans and new 
        environments, including flight responses and reactivity to 
        external stimuli.[12]: Fig 1 It is proposed that there were 
        three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed 
        into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche 
        (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals 
        sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, 
        yak, pig, reindeer, llama, alpaca, and turkey); and (3) 
        targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, 
        donkey, camel).The dog was the first to be domesticated,and 
        was established across Eurasia before the end of the Late 
        Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the 
        domestication of other animals.Unlike other domestic 
        species which were primarily selected for production-related 
        traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.The 
        archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term 
        bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – 
        including donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, 
        sheep, and pigs – was common. One study has concluded that 
        human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the 
        homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs and 
        created domestication islands in the genome. The same process 
        may also apply to other domesticated animals. Some of the most
        commonly domesticated animals are cats and dogs.
