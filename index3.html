    <h1>Domestic Animals</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Domestication</h2>
        <p>The domestication of animals is the mutual relationship 
        between animals and the humans who have influence on their 
        care and reproduction.</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Backing_sheep_at_sheepdog_competition.jpg" alt="Domestic Animals"> Darwin recognized a small 
        number of traits that made domesticated species different 
        from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to 
        recognize the difference between conscious selective 
        breeding (i.e. artificial selection) in which humans 
        directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious 
        selection where traits evolve as a by-product of natural 
        selection or from selection on other traits. There 
        is a genetic difference between domestic and wild 
        populations. There is also a genetic difference between the 
        domestication traits that researchers believe to have been 
        essential at the early stages of domestication, and the 
        improvement traits that have appeared since the split 
        between wild and domestic populations. 
        Domestication traits are generally fixed within all 
        domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode 
        of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas 
        improvement traits are present only in a proportion of 
        domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds 
        or regional populations.Domestication should not 
        be confused with taming. Taming is the conditioned 
        behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its 
        natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the 
        presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent 
        genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an 
        inherited predisposition toward humans. Certain 
        animal species, and certain individuals within those 
        species, make better candidates for domestication than 
        others because they exhibit certain behavioral 
        characteristics:  the size and organization of their 
        social structure;  the availability and the degree of 
        selectivity in their choice of mates;  the ease and speed 
        with which the parents bond with their young, and the 
        maturity and mobility of the young at birth;  the degree 
        of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and 
        responses to humans and new environments, including flight 
        responses and reactivity to external stimuli.It is proposed 
        that there were three major pathways that most animal 
        domesticates followed into domestication: commensals, 
        adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly 
        pigs); prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, 
        cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama, alpaca, 
        and turkey); and  targeted animals for draft and nonfood 
        resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel).The dog was the 
        first to be domesticated, and was established across 
        Eurasia before the end of the Late Pleistocene era, well 
        before cultivation and before the domestication of other 
        animals. Unlike other domestic species which were 
        primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were 
        initially selected for their behaviors. The 
        archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term 
        bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – 
        including donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, 
        goats, sheep, and pigs – was common. One study has 
        concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely 
        counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild 
        boars into pigs and created domestication islands in the 
        genome. </p>

        <h1>Definitions</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Domestication</h2>
        <p>Domestication has been defined as "a sustained 
            multi-generational, mutualistic relationship in which one 
            organism assumes a significant degree of influence over 
            the reproduction and care of another organism in order to 
            secure a more predictable supply of a resource of 
            interest, and through which the partner organism gains 
            advantage over individuals that remain outside this 
            relationship, thereby benefitting and often increasing the 
            fitness of both the domesticator and the target 
            domesticate." This definition recognizes both the 
            biological and the cultural components of the domestication 
            process and the effects on both humans and the domesticated 
            animals and plants. All past definitions of domestication 
            have included a relationship between humans with plants and 
            animals, but their differences lay in who was considered as 
            the lead partner in the relationship. This new definition 
            recognizes a mutualistic relationship in which both partners 
            gain benefits. Domestication has vastly enhanced the 
            reproductive output of crop plants, livestock, and pets far 
            beyond that of their wild progenitors. Domesticates have 
            provided humans with resources that they could more 
            predictably and securely control, move, and redistribute, 
            which has been the advantage that had fueled a population 
            explosion of the agro-pastoralists and their spread to all 
            corners of the planet.</p>
            <hr>
        <h2>Domestication syndrome</h2>
        <p>Domestication syndrome is a term often used to describe the 
            suite of phenotypic traits arising during domestication 
            that distinguish crops from their wild ancestors. 
            The term is also applied to animals and includes increased 
            docility and tameness, coat color changes, reductions in 
            tooth size, changes in craniofacial morphology, 
            alterations in ear and tail form (e.g., floppy ears), more 
            frequent and nonseasonal estrus cycles, alterations in 
            adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, changed concentrations 
            of several neurotransmitters, prolongations in juvenile 
            behavior, and reductions in both total brain size and of 
            particular brain regions. The set of traits used to define 
            the animal domestication syndrome is inconsistent.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Difference from taming</h2>
        <p>Domestication should not be confused with taming. Taming is 
            the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born 
            animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and 
            it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is 
            the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that 
            leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans. Human 
            selection included tameness, but without a suitable 
            evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved.
            Domestic animals need not be tame in the behavioral sense, 
            such as the Spanish fighting bull. Wild animals can be 
            tame, such as a hand-raised cheetah. A domestic animal's 
            breeding is controlled by humans and its tameness and 
            tolerance of humans is genetically determined. However, an 
            animal merely bred in captivity is not necessarily 
            domesticated. Tigers, gorillas, and polar bears breed 
            readily in captivity but are not domesticated. Asian 
            elephants are wild animals that with taming manifest 
            outward signs of domestication, yet their breeding is not 
            human controlled and thus they are not true domesticates.

        <hr>
        <p><img src="http://pages.vassar.edu/realarchaeology/files/2018/09/domestication-based-on-archeology.png" alt="History,cause and timing">The domestication of animals and plants was triggered by 
            the climatic and environmental changes that occurred 
            after the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum around 21,000 
            years ago and which continue to this present day. These 
            changes made obtaining food difficult. The first 
            domesticate was the domestic dog (Canis lupus 
            familiaris) from a wolf ancestor (Canis lupus) at least 
            15,000 years ago. The Younger Dryas that occurred 12,900 
            years ago was a period of intense cold and aridity that 
            put pressure on humans to intensify their foraging 
            strategies. By the beginning of the Holocene from 11,700 
            years ago, favorable climatic conditions and increasing 
            human populations led to small-scale animal and plant 
            domestication, which allowed humans to augment the food 
            that they were obtaining through hunter-gathering.The 
            increased use of agriculture and continued domestication 
            of species during the Neolithic transition marked the 
            beginning of a rapid shift in the evolution, ecology, 
            and demography of both humans and numerous species of 
            animals and plants. Areas with increasing 
            agriculture, underwent urbanisation, developing 
            higher-density populations, expanded economies, 
            and became centers of livestock and crop domestication.
            Such agricultural societies emerged across 
            Eurasia, North Africa, and South and Central America.
            In the Fertile Crescent 10,000-11,000 years ago, 
            zooarchaeology indicates that goats, pigs, sheep, and 
            taurine cattle were the first livestock to be 
            domesticated. Archaeologists working in Cyprus found an 
            older burial ground, approximately 9500 years old, of an 
            adult human with a feline skeleton. Two thousand 
            years later, humped zebu cattle were domesticated in 
            what is today Baluchistan in Pakistan. In East Asia 
            8,000 years ago, pigs were domesticated from wild boar 
            that were genetically different from those found in the 
            Fertile Crescent. The horse was domesticated on the 
            Central Asian steppe 5,500 years ago. The chicken in 
            Southeast Asia was domesticated 4,000 years ago.</p>

        <h2>Brain size and function</h2>
        <hr>        
        <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Unnatural_selection%2C_2_heads%2C_one_species.jpg/800px-Unnatural_selection%2C_2_heads%2C_one_species.jpg" alt="brain photo"> 
            The sustained selection for lowered reactivity among 
            mammal domesticates has resulted in profound changes in 
            brain form and function.larger the size of the 
            brain to begin with and the greater its degree of folding, 
            the greater the degree of brain-size reduction under 
            domestication.Foxes that had been selectively bred for 
            tameness over 40 years had experienced a significant 
            reduction in cranial height and width and by inference in 
            brain size, which supports the hypothesis that brain-size 
            reduction is an early response to the selective pressure 
            for tameness and lowered reactivity that is the universal 
            feature of animal domestication.The most affected portion of 
            the brain in domestic mammals is the limbic system, which 
            in domestic dogs, pigs, and sheep show a 40% reduction in 
            size compared with their wild species. This portion of the 
            brain regulates endocrine function that influences 
            behaviors such as aggression, wariness, and responses to 
            environmentally induced stress, all attributes which are 
            dramatically affected by domestication<mark>Canis lupus. 
            Each skull was photographed from the same focal 
            distance with a fixed zoom; the images were then 
            combined while preserving scale. The larger skull is 
            from a wild grey wolf. The smaller is from a chihuahua.
            They are in fact considered the same species. The 
            domestic dog is the product of artificial selection 
            over many generations. Suitable example for evolution

        <h1>Pleiotropy</h1>
        <hr>
        <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap.jpg" alt="pleiotropy phto">A putative cause for the broad changes seen in domestication 
            syndrome is pleiotropy. Pleiotropy occurs when one gene 
            influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. 
            Certain physiological changes characterize domestic animals 
            of many species. These changes include extensive white 
            markings (particularly on the head), floppy ears, and curly 
            tails. These arise even when tameness is the only trait under 
            selective pressure. The genes involved in tameness are 
            largely unknown, so it is not known how or to what extent 
            pleiotropy contributes to domestication syndrome. Tameness 
            may be caused by the down regulation of fear and stress 
            responses via reduction of the adrenal glands. Based on 
            this, the pleiotropy hypotheses can be separated into two 
            theories. The Neural Crest Hypothesis relates adrenal gland 
            function to deficits in neural crest cells during 
            development. The Single Genetic Regulatory Network Hypothesis 
            claims that genetic changes in upstream regulators affect 
            downstream systems.Neural crest cells (NCC) are 
            vertebrate embryonic stem cells that function directly 
            and indirectly during early embryogenesis to produce 
            many tissue types. Because the traits commonly 
            affected by domestication syndrome are all derived from 
            NCC in development, the neural crest hypothesis suggests 
            that deficits in these cells cause the domain of 
            phenotypes seen in domestication syndrome. These 
            deficits could cause changes we see to many domestic 
            mammals, such as lopped ears (seen in rabbit, dog, fox, 
            pig, sheep, goat, cattle, and donkeys) as well as curly 
            tails (pigs, foxes, and dogs). Although they do not 
            affect the development of the adrenal cortex directly, 
            the neural crest cells may be involved in relevant 
            upstream embryological interactions. Furthermore, 
            artificial selection targeting tameness may affect genes 
            that control the concentration or movement of NCCs in 
            the embryo, leading to a variety of phenotypes.The 
            single genetic regulatory network hypothesis proposes 
            that domestication syndrome results from mutations in 
            genes that regulate the expression pattern of more 
            downstream genes. For example piebald, or spotted 
            coat coloration, may be caused by a linkage in the 
            biochemical pathways of melanins involved in coat 
            coloration and neurotransmitters such as dopamine that 
            help shape behavior and cognition.These linked 
            traits may arise from mutations in a few key regulatory 
            genes. A problem with this hypothesis is that it 
            proposes that there are mutations in gene networks that 
            cause dramatic effects that are not lethal, however no 
            currently known genetic regulatory networks cause such 
            dramatic change in so many different traits.</p>
            <hr><hr>
            <h1>Universal features</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>The biomass of wild vertebrates is now increasingly 
                small compared to the biomass of domestic animals, 
                with the calculated biomass of domestic cattle alone 
                being greater than that of all wild mammals. Because 
                the evolution of domestic animals is ongoing, the 
                process of domestication has a beginning but not an 
                end. Various criteria have been established to provide 
                a definition of domestic animals, but all decisions 
                about exactly when an animal can be labelled 
                "domesticated" in the zoological sense are arbitrary, 
                although potentially useful. Domestication is a fluid 
                and nonlinear process that may start, stop, reverse, 
                or go down unexpected paths with no clear or universal 
                threshold that separates the wild from the domestic. 
                However, there are universal features held in common 
                by all domesticated animals.

            <h2>Behavioral preadaption</h2>
            <p>Certain animal species, and certain individuals within 
                those species, make better candidates for 
                domestication than others because they exhibit certain 
                behavioral characteristics: the size and organization 
                of their social structure; the availability and the 
                degree of selectivity in their choice of mates; the 
                ease and speed with which the parents bond with their 
                young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at 
                birth; the degree of flexibility in diet and habitat 
                tolerance; and responses to humans and new 
                environments, including flight responses and reactivity 
                to external stimuli.</p><p><img src="https://0.academia-photos.com/attachment_thumbnails/40702079/mini_magick20190220-6641-ka75yw.png?1550700745" alt="behavior preadaption photo"> Fig 1  Reduced wariness to humans 
                and low reactivity to both humans and other external 
                stimuli are a key pre-adaptation for domestication, and 
                these behaviors are also the primary target of the 
                selective pressures experienced by the animal undergoing 
                domestication. This implies that not all animals can be 
                domesticated, e.g. a wild member of the horse family, 
                the zebra.Jared Diamond in his book Guns, Germs, and 
                Steel enquired as to why, among the world's 148 large 
                wild terrestrial herbivorous mammals, only 14 were 
                domesticated, and proposed that their wild ancestors 
                must have possessed six characteristics before they 
                could be considered for domestication:diet – 
                Animals that can efficiently process what they eat and 
                live off plants are less expensive to keep in captivity. 
                Carnivores feed on flesh, which would require the 
                domesticators to raise additional animals to feed the 
                carnivores and therefore increase the consumption of 
                plants further.Quick growth rate – Fast maturity rate 
                compared to the human life span allows breeding 
                intervention and makes the animal useful within an 
                acceptable duration of caretaking. Some large animals 
                require many years before they reach a useful size.
                Ability to breed in captivity – Animals that will not 
                breed in captivity are limited to acquisition through 
                capture in the wild.Pleasant disposition – Animals 
                with nasty dispositions are dangerous to keep around 
                humans.Tendency not to panic – Some species are 
                nervous, fast, and prone to flight when they perceive 
                a threat.Social structure – All species of 
                domesticated large mammals had wild ancestors that 
                lived in herds with a dominance hierarchy amongst the 
                herd members, and the herds had overlapping home 
                territories rather than mutually exclusive home 
                territories. This arrangement allows humans to take 
                control of the dominance hierarchy.</p>

        <h2>Brain size and function</h2>
        <p>The sustained selection for lowered reactivity among mammal 
            domesticates has resulted in profound changes in brain form and 
            function. The larger the size of the brain to begin with and the 
            greater its degree of folding, the greater the degree of brain-size 
            reduction under domestication. Foxes that had been selectively bred 
            for tameness over 40 years had experienced a significant reduction in 
            cranial height and width and by inference in brain size, which 
            supports the hypothesis that brain-size reduction is an early 
            response to the selective pressure for tameness and lowered 
            reactivity that is the universal feature of animal domestication. The 
            most affected portion of the brain in domestic mammals is the limbic 
            system, which in domestic dogs, pigs, and sheep show a 40% reduction 
            in size compared with their wild species. This portion of the brain 
            regulates endocrine function that influences behaviors such as 
            aggression, wariness, and responses to environmentally induced 
            stress, all attributes which are dramatically affected by 
            domestication.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Pleiotropy</h2>
            <p>A putative cause for the broad changes seen in domestication 
                syndrome is pleiotropy. Pleiotropy occurs when one gene 
                influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. 
                Certain physiological changes characterize domestic animals of 
                many species. These changes include extensive white markings 
                (particularly on the head), floppy ears, and curly tails.</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Cows_in_green_field_-_nullamunjie_olive_grove03.jpg/1920px-Cows_in_green_field_-_nullamunjie_olive_grove03.jpg" alt="photo"> These 
                arise even when tameness is the only trait under selective 
                pressure. The genes involved in tameness are largely unknown, 
                so it is not known how or to what extent pleiotropy contributes 
                to domestication syndrome. Tameness may be caused by the down 
                regulation of fear and stress responses via reduction of the 
                adrenal glands. Based on this, the pleiotropy hypotheses can 
                be separated into two theories. The Neural Crest Hypothesis 
                relates adrenal gland function to deficits in neural crest cells 
                during development. The Single Genetic Regulatory Network 
                Hypothesis claims that genetic changes in upstream regulators 
                affect downstream systems.Neural crest cells (NCC) are vertebrate 
                embryonic stem cells that function directly and indirectly during
                early embryogenesis to produce many tissue types. Because the 
                traits commonly affected by domestication syndrome are all 
                derived from NCC in development, the neural crest hypothesis 
                suggests that deficits in these cells cause the domain of 
                phenotypes seen in domestication syndrome.These deficits could 
                cause changes we see to many domestic mammals, such as lopped 
                ears (seen in rabbit, dog, fox, pig, sheep, goat, cattle, and 
                donkeys) as well as curly tails (pigs, foxes, and dogs). Although 
                they do not affect the development of the adrenal cortex 
                directly, the neural crest cells may be involved in relevant 
                upstream embryological interactions. Furthermore, artificial 
                selection targeting tameness may affect genes that control the 
                concentration or movement of NCCs in the embryo, leading to a 
                variety of phenotypes.The single genetic regulatory network 
                hypothesis proposes that domestication syndrome results from 
                mutations in genes that regulate the expression pattern of more 
                downstream genes.For example piebald, or spotted coat coloration, 
                may be caused by a linkage in the biochemical pathways of 
                melanins involved in coat coloration and neurotransmitters such 
                as dopamine that help shape behavior and cognition. These linked 
                traits may arise from mutations in a few key regulatory genes. 
                A problem with this hypothesis is that it proposes that there 
                are mutations in gene networks that cause dramatic effects that 
                are not lethal, however no currently known genetic regulatory 
                networks cause such dramatic change in so many different traits.

                <h2>Limited reversion</h2>
                <p>Feral mammals such as dogs, cats, goats, donkeys, pigs, and 
                    ferrets that have lived apart from humans for generations 
                    show no sign of regaining the brain mass of their wild 
                    progenitors. Dingos have lived apart from humans for 
                    thousands of years but still have the same brain size as 
                    that of a domestic dog.Feral dogs that actively avoid human 
                    contact are still dependent on human waste for survival and 
                    have not reverted to the self-sustaining behaviors of their 
                    wolf ancestors.</p>

        <h1>Pathways</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Since 2012, a multi-stage model of animal domestication has been 
            accepted by two groups. The first group proposed that animal 
            domestication proceeded along a continuum of stages from anthropophily, 
            commensalism, control in the wild, control of captive animals, extensive 
            breeding, intensive breeding, and finally to pets in a slow, gradually 
            intensifying relationship between humans and animals.The second group 
            proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal 
            domesticates followed into domestication: commensals, adapted to a 
            human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); prey animals 
            sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, 
            reindeer, llama and alpaca); and  targeted animals for draft and 
            nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel).The beginnings of 
            animal domestication involved a protracted coevolutionary process 
            with multiple stages along different pathways. Humans did not intend 
            to domesticate animals from, or at least they did not envision a 
            domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey 
            pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these 
            species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their 
            survival and reproduction, intensified. Although the directed pathway 
            proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as 
            goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest that they take place 
            over much longer time frames.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Commensal pathway</h2>
            <p>The commensal pathway was traveled by vertebrates that fed on 
                refuse around human habitats or by animals that preyed on other 
                animals drawn to human camps. Those animals established a 
                commensal relationship with humans in which the animals benefited 
                but the humans received no harm but little benefit. Those animals 
                that were most capable of taking advantage of the resources 
                associated with human camps would have been the tamer, less 
                aggressive individuals with shorter fight or flight distances.
                Later, these animals developed closer social or economic bonds 
                with humans that led to a domestic relationship.The leap from a 
                synanthropic population to a domestic one could only have taken 
                place after the animals had progressed from anthropophily to 
                habituation, to commensalism and partnership, when the 
                relationship between animal and human would have laid the 
                foundation for domestication, including captivity and 
                human-controlled breeding. From this perspective, animal 
                domestication is a coevolutionary process in which a population 
                responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel niche 
                that included another species with evolving behaviors.Commensal 
                pathway animals include dogs, cats, fowl, and possibly pigs.
                The domestication of animals commenced over 15,000 years before 
                present (YBP), beginning with the grey wolf (Canis lupus) by 
                nomadic hunter-gatherers. It was not until 11,000 YBP that people 
                living in the Near East entered into relationships with wild 
                populations of aurochs, boar, sheep, and goats. A domestication 
                process then began to develop. The grey wolf most likely followed 
                the commensal pathway to domestication. When, where, and how many 
                times wolves may have been domesticated remains debated because 
                only a small number of ancient specimens have been found, and 
                both archaeology and genetics continue to provide conflicting 
                evidence. The most widely accepted, earliest dog remains date 
                back 15,000 YBP to the Bonn–Oberkassel dog. Earlier remains 
                dating back to 30,000 YBP have been described as Paleolithic 
                dogs, however their status as dogs or wolves remains debated. 
                Recent studies indicate that a genetic divergence occurred 
                between dogs and wolves 20,000–40,000 YBP, however this is the 
                upper time-limit for domestication because it represents the time 
                of divergence and not the time of domestication.The chicken is 
                one of the most widespread domesticated species and one of the 
                human world's largest sources of protein. Although the chicken 
                was domesticated in South-East Asia, archaeological evidence 
                suggests that it was not kept as a livestock species until 400 
                BCE in the Levant. Prior to this, chickens had been associated 
                with humans for thousands of years and kept for cock-fighting, 
                rituals, and royal zoos, so they were not originally a prey 
                species.The chicken was not a popular food in Europe until only 
                one thousand years ago</p>
                <hr>
        <h2>Prey pathway</h2>
        <p>The prey pathway was the way in which most major livestock species 
            entered into domestication as these were once hunted by humans for 
            their meat. Domestication was likely initiated when humans began to 
            experiment with hunting strategies designed to increase the 
            availability of these prey, perhaps as a response to localized 
            pressure on the supply of the animal. Over time and with the more 
            responsive species, these game-management strategies developed into 
            herd-management strategies that included the sustained 
            multi-generational control over the animals’ movement, feeding, and 
            reproduction. As human interference in the life-cycles of prey 
            animals intensified, the evolutionary pressures for a lack of 
            aggression would have led to an acquisition of the same domestication 
            syndrome traits found in the commensal domesticates.Prey pathway 
            animals include sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, 
            reindeer, llama and alpaca. The right conditions for the domestication 
            for some of them appear to have been in place in the central and 
            eastern Fertile Crescent at the end of the Younger Dryas climatic 
            downturn and the beginning of the Early Holocene about 11,700 YBP, 
            and by 10,000 YBP people were preferentially killing young males of a 
            variety of species and allowed the females to live in order to 
            produce more offspring.By measuring the size, sex ratios, and 
            mortality profiles of zooarchaeological specimens, archeologists have 
            been able to document changes in the management strategies of hunted 
            sheep, goats, pigs, and cows in the Fertile Crescent starting 11,700 
            YBP. A recent demographic and metrical study of cow and pig remains 
            at Sha’ar Hagolan, Israel, demonstrated that both species were 
            severely overhunted before domestication, suggesting that the 
            intensive exploitation led to management strategies adopted 
            throughout the region that ultimately led to the domestication of 
            these populations following the prey pathway. This pattern of 
            overhunting before domestication suggests that the prey pathway was 
            as accidental and unintentional as the commensal pathway.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Directed pathway</h2>
            <p>The directed pathway was a more deliberate and directed process 
                initiated by humans with the goal of domesticating a free-living 
                animal.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Kazakh_shepard_with_dogs_and_horse.jpg" alt="pathway of photo"> It probably only came into being once people were 
                familiar with either commensal or prey-pathway domesticated 
                animals. These animals were likely not to possess many of the 
                behavioral preadaptions some species show before domestication. 
                Therefore, the domestication of these animals requires more 
                deliberate effort by humans to work around behaviors that do not 
                assist domestication, with increased technological assistance 
                needed.Humans were already reliant on domestic plants and animals 
                when they imagined the domestic versions of wild animals. 
                Although horses, donkeys, and Old World camels were sometimes 
                hunted as prey species, they were each deliberately brought into 
                the human niche for sources of transport. Domestication was still 
                a multi-generational adaptation to human selection pressures, 
                including tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response 
                then domestication was not achieved. For example, despite the 
                fact that hunters of the Near Eastern gazelle in the 
                Epipaleolithic avoided culling reproductive females to promote 
                population balance, neither gazelles nor zebras possessed the 
                necessary prerequisites and were never domesticated. There is no 
                clear evidence for the domestication of any herded prey animal in 
                Africa, with the notable exception of the donkey, which was 
                domesticated in Northeast Africa sometime in the 4th millennium 
                BCE.</p>
