      </a>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz
          /), characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs
          , a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight 
          skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee 
          hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living 
          species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have 
          wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without 
          wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, 
          gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of 
          flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island 
          species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted 
          for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and 
          some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.Birds are feathered theropod 
          dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are 
          considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest 
          living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive 
          avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared about 160 
          million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA evidence, modern birds 
          (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically 
          around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed 
          off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs.Many social species pass on knowledge 
          across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Birds are social, 
          communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such 
          behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. 
          The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) 
          monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, and 
          rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male 
          with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds 
          produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. 
          They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an 
          extended period of parental care after hatching.Many species of birds are 
          economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in 
          manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of 
          eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. 
          Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout 
          human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity 
          since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens 
          about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect 
          them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.

        <h1>Evolution and classification</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The first classification of birds was developed by Francis 
          Willughby and John Ray in their 1676 volume Ornithologiae.Carl 
          Linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic 
          classification system currently in use.Birds are categorised as the 
          biological class Aves in Linnaean taxonomy. Phylogenetic taxonomy 
          places Aves in the clade Theropoda.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p><a target="_self" href="zz.jpg" alt="Animal photo">
          <img src="zz.jpg" alt="Animal photo" style="width:200px">
        </a>Aves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia, contain the only 
        living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the 
        late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all 
        descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and 
        Archaeopteryx lithographica.However, an earlier definition proposed by 
        Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used 
        by many scientists including adherents to the PhyloCode. Gauthier 
        defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern 
        birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, 
        and assigning them, instead, to the broader group Avialae,in part to 
        avoid the uncertainties about the placement of Archaeopteryx in 
        relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.
        [citation needed]Gauthier and de Queiroz identified four different 
        definitions for the same biological name "Aves", which is a problem. 
        The authors proposed to reserve the term Aves only for the crown group 
        consisting of the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of 
        its descendants, which corresponds to meaning number 4 below. He 
        assigned other names to the other groups.<br>
        1.Aves can mean all archosaurs closer to birds than to crocodiles 
        (alternately Avemetatarsalia).<br>
        2.Aves can mean those advanced archosaurs with feathers (alternately Avifilopluma).
        <br>3.Aves can mean those feathered dinosaurs that fly (alternately Avialae).
        <br>4.Aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living 
        birds and all of its descendants (a "crown group", in this sense 
        synonymous with Neornithes).<br>Under the fourth definition Archaeopteryx, 
        traditionally considered one of the earliest members of Aves, is 
        removed from this group, becoming a non-avian dinosaur instead. These 
        proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of 
        palaeontology and bird evolution, though the exact definitions applied 
        have been inconsistent. Avialae, initially proposed to replace the 
        traditional fossil content of Aves, is often used synonymously with 
        the vernacular term "bird" by these researchers.Most researchers 
        define Avialae as branch-based clade, though definitions vary. Many 
        authors have used a definition similar to "all theropods closer to 
        birds than to Deinonychus",with Troodon being sometimes added as a 
        second external specifier in case it is closer to birds than to 
        Deinonychus.Avialae is also occasionally defined as an apomorphy-based 
        clade (that is, one based on physical characteristics). Jacques 
        Gauthier, who named Avialae in 1986, re-defined it in 2001 as all 
        dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight, and 
        the birds that descended from them.Despite being currently one of the 
        most widely used, the crown-group definition of Aves has been 
        criticised by some researchers. Lee and Spencer (1997) argued that, 
        contrary to what Gauthier defended, this definition would not increase 
        the stability of the clade and the exact content of Aves will always 
        be uncertain because any defined clade (either crown or not) will have 
        few synapomorphies distinguishing it from its closest relatives. Their 
        alternative definition is synonymous to Avifilopluma.

      <h2>Dinosaurs and the origin of birds</h2>
      <p><a target="_self" href="xx.png" alt="Animal photo">
        <img src="xx.png" alt="Animal photo" style="width:200px">
      </a>Based on fossil and biological evidence, most scientists accept that 
      birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs and, more 
      specifically, members of Maniraptora, a group of theropods which 
      includes dromaeosaurids and oviraptorosaurs, among others.As scientists 
      have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously 
      clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent 
      discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which 
      demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this 
      ambiguity.
    </p><br>
    <p><a target="_self" href="cc.jpg" alt="Animal photo">
      <img src="cc.jpg" alt="Animal photo" style="width:90px">
    </a>The consensus view in contemporary palaeontology is that the flying 
    theropods, or avialans, are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs, 
    which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids.Together, these form a group 
    called Paraves. Some basal members of Deinonychosauria, such as 
    Microraptor, have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly. 
    The most basal deinonychosaurs were very small. This evidence raises the 
    possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal, 
    have been able to glide, or both.Unlike Archaeopteryx and the non-avialan 
    feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, recent studies suggest that 
    the first avialans were omnivores.The Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is well 
    known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found, and it 
    provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century. 
    Archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional 
    reptilian characteristics—teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like 
    tail—as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern 
    birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it is 
    possibly closely related to the true ancestor.

  <h2>Early evolution</h2>
  <p><a target="_self" href="vv.jpg" alt="Animal photo">
    <img src="vv.jpg" alt="Animal photo" style="width:190px">
  </a>Over 40% of key traits found in modern birds evolved during the 60 
  million year transition from the earliest bird-line archosaurs to the first 
  maniraptoromorphs, i.e. the first dinosaurs closer to living birds than to 
  Tyrannosaurus rex. The loss of osteoderms otherwise common in archosaurs and 
  acquisition of primitive feathers might have occurred early during this 
  phase.[14][34] After the appearance of Maniraptoromorpha, the next 40 
  million years marked a continuous reduction of body size and the 
  accumulation of neotenic (juvenile-like) characteristics. Hypercarnivory 
  became increasingly less common while braincases enlarged and forelimbs 
  became longer.The integument evolved into complex, pennaceous feathers.
  The oldest known paravian (and probably the earliest avialan) fossils come 
  from the Tiaojishan Formation of China, which has been dated to the late 
  Jurassic period (Oxfordian stage), about 160 million years ago. The avialan 
  species from this time period include Anchiornis huxleyi, Xiaotingia zhengi, 
  and Aurornis xui.The well-known probable early avialan, Archaeopteryx, dates 
  from slightly later Jurassic rocks (about 155 million years old) from 
  Germany. Many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features 
  that may be ancestral to modern birds, but were later lost during bird 
  evolution. These features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may 
  have been held clear of the ground in life, and long feathers or "hind 
  wings" covering the hind limbs and feet, which may have been used in aerial 
  manoeuvreing.Avialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the 
  Cretaceous period. Many groups retained primitive characteristics, such as 
  clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a 
  number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves).Increasingly stiff 
  tails (especially the outermost half) can be seen in the evolution of 
  maniraptoromorphs, and this process culminated in the appearance of the 
  pygostyle, an ossification of fused tail vertebrae.In the late Cretaceous, 
  about 100 million years ago, the ancestors of all modern birds evolved a 
  more open pelvis, allowing them to lay larger eggs compared to body size. 
  Around 95 million years ago, they evolved a better sense of smell.A third 
  stage of bird evolution starting with Ornithothoraces (the "bird-chested" 
  avialans) can be associated with the refining of aerodynamics and flight 
  capabilities, and the loss or co-ossification of several skeletal features. 
  Particularly significant are the development of an enlarged, keeled sternum 
  and the alula, and the loss of grasping hands.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Early diversity of bird ancestors</h2>
<p>The first large, diverse lineage of short-tailed avialans to evolve were 
  the Enantiornithes, or "opposite birds", so named because the construction 
  of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds. 
  Enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches, from sand-probing 
  shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters. While 
  they were the dominant group of avialans during the Cretaceous period, 
  enantiornithes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the 
  end of the Mesozoic era.Many species of the second major avialan lineage to 
  diversify, the Euornithes (meaning "true birds", because they include the 
  ancestors of modern birds), were semi-aquatic and specialised in eating fish 
  and other small aquatic organisms. Unlike the Enantiornithes, which 
  dominated land-based and arboreal habitats, most early euornithes lacked 
  perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebird-like species, 
  waders, and swimming and diving species.[citation needed]The latter included 
  the superficially gull-like Ichthyornis and the Hesperornithiformes, which 
  became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost 
  the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic. The early euornithes also 
  saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like 
  strongly keeled breastbones, toothless, beaked portions of their jaws 
  (though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws).
  Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a 
  fully mobile fan of tail feathers,which may have replaced the "hind wing" as 
  the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.A study on 
  mosaic evolution in the avian skull found that the last common ancestor of 
  all Neornithes might have had a beak similar to that of the modern 
  hook-billed vanga and a skull similar to that of the Eurasian golden oriole. 
  As both species are small aerial and canopy foraging omnivores, a similar 
  ecological niche was inferred for this hypothetical ancestor.

<h2>Diversification of modern birds</h2>
<p><a target="_self" href="bb.png" alt="Animal photo">
  <img src="bb.png" alt="Animal photo" style="width:190px">
</a>All modern birds lie within the crown group Aves (alternately Neornithes), 
which has two subdivisions: the Palaeognathae, which includes the flightless 
ratites (such as the ostriches) and the weak-flying tinamous, and the 
extremely diverse Neognathae, containing all other birds.These two 
subdivisions have variously been given the rank of superorder,cohort,or 
infraclass.Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint, the number of known living 
bird species varies anywhere from 9,800 to 10,758.The discovery of Vegavis 
from the Maastrichtian, the last stage of the Late Cretaceous proved that the 
diversification of modern birds started before the Cenozoic era.The affinities 
of an earlier fossil, the possible galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to 
about 85 million years ago,are still too controversial to provide a fossil 
evidence of modern bird diversification. In 2020, Asteriornis from the 
Maastrichtian was described, it appears to be a close relative of 
Galloanserae, the earliest diverging lineage within Neognathae.Most studies 
agree on a Cretaceous age for the most recent common ancestor of modern birds 
but estimates range from the Early Cretaceous to the latest Late Cretaceous.
Similarly, there is no agreement on whether most of the early diversification 
of modern birds occurred before or after the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction 
event.This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; 
most molecular dating studies suggests a Cretaceous evolutionary radiation, 
while fossil evidence points to a Cenozoic radiation (the so-called 'rocks' 
versus 'clocks' controversy). Previous attempts to reconcile molecular and 
fossil evidence have proved controversial,but more recent estimates, using a 
more comprehensive sample of fossils and a new way of calibrating molecular 
clocks, showed that while according to some studies, modern birds originated 
early in the Late Cretaceous in Western Gondwana, a pulse of diversification 
in all major groups occurred around the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction 
event. Modern birds expanded from West Gondwana to the Laurasia through two 
routes. One route was an Antarctic interchange in the Paleogene. This can be 
confirmed with the presence of multiple avian groups in Australia and New 
Zealand. The other route was probably through North America, via land bridges, 
during the Paleocene. This allowed the expansion and diversification of 
Neornithes into the Holarctic and Paleotropics. On the other hand, the 
occurrence of Asteriornis in the Northern Hemisphere challenges 
biogeographical hypotheses of a Gondwanan origin of crown birds.

<h2>Genomics</h2>
<p>As of 2010, the genome had been sequenced for only two birds, the chicken 
  and the zebra finch. As of 2022 the genomes of 542 species of birds had been 
  completed. At least one genome has been sequenced from every order.These 
  include at least one species in about 90% of extant avian families (218 out 
  of 236 families recognised by the Howard and Moore Checklist).Being able to 
  sequence and compare whole genomes gives researchers many types of 
  information, about genes, the DNA that regulates the genes, and their 
  evolutionary history. This has led to reconsideration of some of the 
  classifications that were based solely on the identification of protein-
  coding genes. Waterbirds such as pelicans and flamingos, for example, may 
  have in common specific adaptations suited to their environment that were 
  developed independently.

<h1>Distribution</h1>
<hr>
<p><a target="_self" href="nn.jpg" alt="Animal photo">
  <img src="nn.jpg" alt="Animal photo" style="width:190px">
</a>Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven 
continents, reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel's breeding 
colonies up to 440 kilometres (270 mi) inland in Antarctica.The highest bird 
diversity occurs in tropical regions. It was earlier thought that this high 
diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics; however 
recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were 
offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics.Many species migrate 
annually over great distances and across oceans; several families of birds 
have adapted to life both on the world's oceans and in them, and some seabird 
species come ashore only to breed,while some penguins have been recorded 
diving up to 300 metres (980 ft) deep.Many bird species have established 
breeding populations in areas to which they have been introduced by humans. 
Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, 
for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird.Others have 
been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several 
North American cities after their escape from captivity.Some species, 
including cattle egret, yellow-headed caracara and galah, have spread 
naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural expansion created 
alternative habitats although modern practices of intensive agriculture have 
negatively impacted farmland bird populations.
</p>
<hr><hr>
<h1>Anatomy and physiology</h1>
<hr>
<p>Compared with other vertebrates, birds have a body plan that shows many 
  unusual adaptations, mostly to facilitate flight.<a target="_self" href="mm.png" alt="Animal photo">
    <img src="mm.png" alt="Animal photo" style="width:190px">
  </a><h2>Skeletal system</h2>
<br>
The skeleton consists of very lightweight bones. They have large air-filled 
cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which connect with the respiratory system.
The skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures.The 
orbital cavities that house the eyeballs are large and separated from each 
other by a bony septum (partition). The spine has cervical, thoracic, lumbar 
and caudal regions with the number of cervical (neck) vertebrae highly 
variable and especially flexible, but movement is reduced in the anterior 
thoracic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae.The last few are fused 
with the pelvis to form the synsacrum. The ribs are flattened and the sternum 
is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird 
orders. The forelimbs are modified into wings. The wings are more or less 
developed depending on the species; the only known groups that lost their 
wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Excretory system</h2>
<p>Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys 
  extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric 
  acid, instead of urea or ammonia, through the ureters into the intestine. 
  Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with 
  exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with faeces as a 
  semisolid waste.However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively 
  ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia.They also 
  excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals.This material, as 
  well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The 
  cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds 
  mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many 
  species of birds regurgitate pellets.It is a common but not universal 
  feature of altricial passerine nestlings (born helpless, under constant 
  parental care) that instead of excreting directly into the nest, they 
  produce a fecal sac. This is a mucus-covered pouch that allows parents to 
  either dispose of the waste outside the nest or to recycle the waste through 
  their own digestive system.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Reproductive system</h2>
<p>Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the 
  Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in 
  Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is 
  never present in Neoaves.The length is thought to be related to sperm 
  competition.When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum 
  compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. Female birds have sperm 
  storage tubules that allow sperm to remain viable long after copulation, a 
  hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete 
  through this mechanism. Most female birds have a single ovary and a single 
  oviduct, both on the left side, but there are exceptions: species in at 
  least 16 different orders of birds have two ovaries. Even these species, 
  however, tend to have a single oviduct.It has been speculated that this 
  might be an adaptation to flight, but males have two testes, and it is also 
  observed that the gonads in both sexes decrease dramatically in size outside 
  the breeding season.Also terrestrial birds generally have a single ovary, as 
  does the platypus, an egg-laying mammal. A more likely explanation is that 
  the egg develops a shell while passing through the oviduct over a period of 
  about a day, so that if two eggs were to develop at the same time, there 
  would be a risk to survival.While rare, mostly abortive, parthenogenesis is 
  not unknown in birds and eggs can be diploid, automictic and results in male 
  offspring.Birds are solely gonochoric.Meaning they have two sexes: either 
  female or male. The sex of birds is determined by the Z and W sex 
  chromosomes, rather than by the X and Y chromosomes present in mammals. Male 
  birds have two Z chromosomes (ZZ), and female birds have a W chromosome and 
  a Z chromosome (WZ).In nearly all species of birds, an individual's sex is 
  determined at fertilisation. However, one 2007 study claimed to demonstrate 
  temperature-dependent sex determination among the Australian brushturkey, 
  for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher 
  female-to-male sex ratio.This, however, was later proven to not be the case. 
  These birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, but 
  temperature-dependent sex mortality.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Respiratory and circulatory systems</h2>
<p>Birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups.
  Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly 
  into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air 
  spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes 
  directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of 
  the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is 
  simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a 
  constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound 
  production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating 
  multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea;
  the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of 
  vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.In birds, the main 
  arteries taking blood away from the heart originate from the right aortic 
  arch (or pharyngeal arch), unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch 
  forms this part of the aorta.The postcava receives blood from the limbs 
  via the renal portal system. Unlike in mammals, the circulating red blood 
  cells in birds retain their nucleus.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Heart type and features</h2>
<p><a target="_self" href="mm.png" alt="Animal photo">
  <img src="mm.png" alt="Animal photo" style="width:190px">
</a>The avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart 
contained in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a 
serous fluid for lubrication.The heart itself is divided into a right 
and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of 
each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow 
from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's 
pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on 
the right atrium.[citation needed] The sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a 
depolarising signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and 
left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. 
The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick 
bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is 
composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers.The atrium walls 
tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular 
contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts 
are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This 
adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need 
associated with flight.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; 
  birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than 
  mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of 
  volume of lung than a mammal.The arteries are composed of thick elastic 
  muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular contractions, and 
  become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the 
  arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a 
  transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to 
  all tissues of the body.As the arterioles move away from the heart and 
  into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase 
  surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and 
  moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.[citation needed]
  Capillaries are organised into capillary beds in tissues; it is here that 
  blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds, 
  blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. 
  Once the blood has become deoxygenated, it travels through venules then 
  veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as 
  they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the 
  venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood 
  back to the heart.Once the blood reaches the heart, it moves first into the 
  right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for 
  further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood 
  then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle 
  where it is pumped out to the body.

<h2>Nervous system</h2>
<p>The nervous system is large relative to the bird's size.The most developed 
  part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions, 
  while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls 
  behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most birds have a 
  poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis,New World 
  vultures and tubenoses. The avian visual system is usually highly 
  developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation 
  for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual fovea. Birds 
  are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the 
  eye as well as green, red and blue ones.They also have double cones, likely 
  to mediate achromatic vision.
</p>
<p><a target="_self" href="mk.jpg" alt="Animal photo">
  <img src="mk.jpg" alt="Animal photo" style="width:190px">
</a>Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the 
human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are 
distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their 
feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is 
displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers.
Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search 
for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground 
by rodents.With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids 
of birds are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the 
nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally.The nictitating 
membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. 
The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.
</p>
<p>Eyes of most birds are large, not very round and capable of only limited 
  movement in the orbits,typically 10–20°. Birds with eyes on the sides of 
  their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of 
  their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth 
  of field.The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, 
  although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers 
  form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not 
  spiral as in mammals.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Defence and intraspecific combat</h2>
<p>A few species are able to use chemical defences against predators; some 
  Procellariiformes can eject an unpleasant stomach oil against an aggressor,
  and some species of pitohuis from New Guinea have a powerful neurotoxin in 
  their skin and feathers.A lack of field observations limit our knowledge, 
  but intraspecific conflicts are known to sometimes result in injury or death.
  The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the 
  spur-winged goose (Plectropterus), the torrent duck (Merganetta) and nine 
  species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The 
  steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire 
  (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some guans (Crax) and stone curlews 
  (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer 
  opponents.The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, 
  blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate 
  forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a 
  jointed club or flail. Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs 
  and bite when defending eggs or young.

<h2>Feathers, plumage, and scales</h2>
<p><a target="_self" href="ml.jpg" alt="Animal photo">
  <img src="ml.jpg" alt="Animal photo" style="width:190px">
</a>Feathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in 
some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate 
flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in 
display, camouflage, and signalling.There are several types of feathers, each 
serving its own set of purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to 
the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The 
distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy 
and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, 
called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.
Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted 
after breeding is known as the "non-breeding" plumage, or—in the 
Humphrey–Parkes terminology—"basic" plumage; breeding plumages or variations 
of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey–Parkes system as "alternate" 
plumages.Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults 
a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting 
patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one 
at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth 
primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the 
innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost 
begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The 
greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they 
overlap.A small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their 
flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, 
the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair.
Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The 
centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and 
treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and 
finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a 
functional climbing tail.The general pattern seen in passerines is 
that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from 
centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare 
brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well 
supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.
</p>
<p><a target="_self" href="mh.jpg" alt="Animal photo">
  <img src="mh.jpg" alt="Animal photo" style="width:150px">
</a>Feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily, spending 
an average of around 9% of their daily time on this.The bill is used to brush 
away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland; 
these secretions protect the feathers' flexibility and act as an antimicrobial 
agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria.This may be 
supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants, which birds receive 
through a behaviour known as anting, to remove feather parasites.The scales of 
birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs. They are 
found mainly on the toes and metatarsus, but may be found further up on the 
ankle in some birds. Most bird scales do not overlap significantly, except in 
the cases of kingfishers and woodpeckers. The scales of birds are thought to 
be homologous to those of reptiles and mammals.

<h2>Flight</h2>
<p><a target="_self" href="mf.jpg" alt="Animal photo">
  <img src="mf.jpg" alt="Animal photo" style="width:190px">
</a>Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other 
vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird 
species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. 
Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, 
two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total 
mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb 
(wing) that serves as an aerofoil.Wing shape and size generally determine a 
bird's flight style and performance; many birds combine powered, flapping 
flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species 
are flightless, as were many extinct birds.Flightlessness often arises in 
birds on isolated islands, most likely due to limited resources and the 
absence of mammalian land predators.Flightlessnes is almost exclusively 
correlated with gigantism due to an island's inheren condition of isolation.
Although flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to "fly" 
through the water, as do some flight-capable birds such as auks, shearwaters 
and dippers.
</p>
<hr><hr>
<h1>Behaviour</h1>
<hr>
<p>Most birds are diurnal, but some birds, such as many species of owls and 
  nightjars, are nocturnal or crepuscular (active during twilight hours), and 
  many coastal waders feed when the tides are appropriate, by day or night.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Diet and feeding</h2>
<p><a target="_self" href="mg.png" alt="Animal photo">
  <img src="mg.png" alt="Animal photo" style="width:70px">
</a>Birds' diets are varied and often include nectar, fruit, plants, seeds, 
carrion, and various small animals, including other birds.The digestive system 
of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains 
swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth.Some 
species such as pigeons and some psittacine species do not have a gallbladder.
Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight.Some 
migratory birds have adapted to use protein stored in many parts of their 
bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during 
migration.Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a 
variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate 
time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain 
food are considered specialists.Avian foraging strategies can vary widely 
by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some 
hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest 
insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their 
presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes.Combined, 
insectivorous birds eat 400–500 million metric tons of arthropods annually.
Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst 
others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed 
to fit co-adapted flowers.Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for 
invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in 
the separation of ecological niches.Loons, diving ducks, penguins 
and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for 
propulsion,while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns 
plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some 
ducks are filter feeders.Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.
Some species, including frigatebirds, gulls,and skuas, engage in 
kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism is 
thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a 
significant part of any species' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing 
from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their 
food and on average stole only 5%.Other birds are scavengers; some of these, 
like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, 
corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Water and drinking</h2>
<p>Water is needed by many birds although their mode of excretion and lack of 
  sweat glands reduces the physiological demands.Some desert birds can obtain 
  their water needs entirely from moisture in their food. They may also have 
  other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on 
  moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting. Seabirds can drink 
  seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out 
  of the nostrils.Most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head 
  to let water run down the throat. Some species, especially of arid zones, 
  belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families 
  are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads.
  Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly 
  well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse 
  and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers.
  Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate 
  it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have 
  adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide 
  to their chicks.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Feather care</h2>
<p>Feathers, being critical to the survival of a bird, require maintenance. 
  Apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, 
  ectoparasitic feather mites and bird lice. The physical condition of 
  feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions 
  from the preen gland. Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While 
  some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips 
  into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect 
  on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A 
  behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through 
  their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in 
  feathers. Many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct 
  sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and 
  ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Migration</h2>
<p><a target="_self" href="md.jpg" alt="Animal photo">
  <img src="md.jpg" alt="Animal photo" style="width:190px">
</a>Many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of 
seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and 
breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many 
landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long-distance 
migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather 
conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the 
temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions 
or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body 
fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.Migration is 
highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts 
and oceans without refuelling. Landbirds have a flight range of around 2,500 
km (1,600 mi) and shorebirds can fly up to 4,000 km (2,500 mi),although the 
bar-tailed godwit is capable of non-stop flights of up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi).
Seabirds also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being 
those of sooty shearwaters, which nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the 
northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, 
an annual round trip of 64,000 km (39,800 mi).Other seabirds disperse after 
breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route. Albatrosses 
nesting in the Southern Ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between 
breeding seasons.Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling 
only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. Irruptive 
species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be 
found at a location in one year and absent the next. This type of migration 
is normally associated with food availability.Species may also travel shorter 
distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes 
travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial 
migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and 
subdominant males, migrates.Partial migration can form a large percentage of 
the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in Australia, surveys found 
that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory.
Altitudinal migration is a form of short-distance migration in which birds 
spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during 
suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and 
usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to 
lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and 
moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are 
overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be 
dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.
The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has 
been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s, a Manx 
shearwater released in Boston in the United States returned to its colony in 
Skomer, in Wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 km (3,200 mi).Birds 
navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For diurnal migrants, 
the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. 
Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during 
the day by the use of an internal clock.Orientation with the stellar compass 
depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris.These are 
backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's geomagnetism 
through specialised photoreceptors.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Birds communicate primarily using visual and auditory signals. Signals can 
  be interspecific (between species) and intraspecific (within species).Birds 
  sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance,to display 
  breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening 
  displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off 
  hawks and protect young chicks.
</p>
<p><a target="_self" href="ms.jpg" alt="Animal photo">
  <img src="ms.jpg" alt="Animal photo" style="width:190px">
</a>Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, 
which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the 
adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays 
may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of 
pair-bonds.The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where "dances" 
are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component 
movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.
Bird calls and songs, which are produced in the syrinx, are the major means by 
which birds communicate with sound. This communication can be very complex; 
some species can operate the two sides of the syrinx independently, allowing 
the simultaneous production of two different songs. Calls are used for a 
variety of purposes, including mate attraction,evaluation of potential mates,
bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories,the identification 
of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when 
mates reunite at the start of breeding season),and the warning of other birds 
of potential predators, sometimes with specific information about the nature 
of the threat.Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication.
The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers,
woodpeckers drum for long-distance communication,and palm cockatoos use tools 
to drum.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Flocking and other associations</h2>
<p>While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family 
  groups, other birds may form large flocks. The principal benefits of 
  flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency.Defence 
  against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, 
  where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable 
  early warning system. This has led to the development of many mixed-species 
  feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; 
  these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition 
  for resources.Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate 
  birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in 
  certain cases.Birds sometimes also form associations with non-avian species. 
  Plunge-diving seabirds associate with dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling 
  fish towards the surface. Some species of hornbills have a mutualistic 
  relationship with dwarf mongooses, in which they forage together and warn 
  each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Resting and roosting</h2>
<p><a target="_self" href="ma.jpg" alt="Animal photo">
  <img src="ma.jpg" alt="Animal photo" style="width:190px">
</a>The high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is 
supplemented by rest at other times. Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep 
known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick 
eye-opening "peeks", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable 
rapid escape from threats.Swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight 
and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in 
their roosting flight.It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds 
of sleep which are possible even when in flight.Some birds have also 
demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the 
brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its 
position relative to the outside of the flock. This may allow the eye opposite 
the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer 
margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from marine mammals.
Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and 
decreases the risks associated with predators.Roosting sites are often chosen 
with regard to thermoregulation and safety.Unusual mobile roost sites include 
large herbivores on the African savanna that are used by oxpeckers.Many 
sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their 
back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. 
Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their 
feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon-locking 
mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep. Many 
ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of 
the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down.Some hummingbirds go into a 
nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates.
This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, 
including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the 
common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation.Birds do not have sweat 
glands, but can lose water directly through the skin, and they may cool 
themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their 
surface area, fluttering their throat or using special behaviours like 
urohidrosis to cool themselves.
